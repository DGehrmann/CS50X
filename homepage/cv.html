        <h1>This is my curriculum.</h1>

        <p>From 2004 to 2013 I went to a public High-School in my hometown. In class 11 I spent one semester abroad at John-Abbott-College in Montreal, Canada. After finishing High-School in March 2013 I decided to do a voluntary service in Indonesia for half a year.
            After that, I continued traveling south-east asia for three more month. I inscribed to Technische Universität Braunschweig for the fall semester 2014 and startet studying Environmental Engineering. In 2017, succeeding one semester on the island of La Réunion,
            I finished my bachelors. I immediately continued my masters in the same subject, focussing on Hydrology, River Engineering and Coastal Engineering. I graduated in November 2020 and started my first job at the Bavarian Environmental Agency in Augsburg, where I
            worked for one and a half years. I then decided to change jobs and am now looking forward to start working in an engineering consultancy from October 2022 onwards.
